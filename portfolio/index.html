            <em>Treehouse</em> is a website <em>Kat</em> and I built as the main website for a resort which rents out trehouses to visitors. It was built using html and css, and owes it's easthetic to a heavy focus on typography and block coloring. Seriously, we spent hours on each of those things. We used pair programming coupled with git to build and manage the project, as well as a decent amount of caffein and chocolate to keep us going.

            <em>daryl.stryyp</em>. Where to start? This is a webpage which serves as a memorial to the first day spent at <em>Epicodus</em>. Three people were involved in the making of said memorial: <em>Aubrey</em>, <em>Tanner</em>, and myself. It started as the outlet for our three hyperactive imaginations who, having now entered a vicious circle, spurred each other on, for better or worse until, well, daryl.stryyp was born. I will point out, at this point, that it ended up being the deapest, darkest and most terrifying of rabbit holes <sup>&yen; </sup>. And with that, I only have one more thing to say: embrace the <strong>yellow</strong>.

              I am musician first and foremoste; I have been for moste of my life and I still believe it is my true passion. Figuring out I would eventually need a stable income, I then decided to study medecine, which I have now given up in favour of persuing web development at <em>Epicodus</em> where I am currently learning how to code. I am familiar with html, css and ruby but I also think I am hard-working (when I <span id="strike">want</span> need to be). I therefore have faith this familiarity will turn into a basic understanding of the above.
